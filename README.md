Purpose: A Silly word game popularly known as Mad Libs 

## Description

Mad Libs is a game, often played by children, where one player will ask another player
for a series of words to formulate a paragraph statement without the other player knowing what the statement 
or scenario will be. 
They do this by asking for specific word classes such as noun, adjective, and verb and filling in the statements 
without the other user seeing. 
For instance a statement could read: I Love to (VERB) on the Weekends. Player 1 would ask player 2 for a verb 
to complete this. Player 2 may say something like "Cry" as a verb
which would produce the statement: I Love to Cry on the Weekends. Mad libs often produces silly outcomes like this
that dont make much sense, but are comical. 

This game functions similarly. When prompted to the User will input into the program the class of words that is requested
the program will store this value and once all required words are input the program will spit out a silly statement
by filling in the input words into a blank space in the paragraph.

After the paragraph is completed the user will be given the option to either play again which will bring the user back to the begginning of the program where requested words are input or given the option to quit which the program will say "Thanks for Playing!" and quit. If the user inputs a statement that is not valid the program will give the message "Please enter a valid response: y or n".
